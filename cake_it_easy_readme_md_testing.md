Below are **two complete files** ready to copy into your repo.

- Save as: `/README.md`
- Save as: `/TESTING.md`
- Create folders for images/reports:
  - `docs/readme/`
  - `docs/testing/`

---

```markdown
# README.md

<!--
This README follows Code Institute PP5 expectations.
Replace TODOs and placeholders (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE) before submission.
Keep image paths/names exactly as suggested so screenshots line up with TESTING.md.
-->


---

```markdown

### Where to put these files
- `README.md` → repo root (appears on GitHub).
- `TESTING.md` → repo root.
- Images → `docs/readme/` and `docs/testing/`.

### Suggested commits
```bash
git checkout -b docs/readme-testing
git add README.md TESTING.md docs/readme/ docs/testing/
git commit -m "docs: add complete README and TESTING templates with screenshot/validation checklists"
git push -u origin docs/readme-testing
```

### Next steps (quick)
1) Replace placeholders in both files.  
2) Start capturing screenshots to the specified filenames.  
3) Ping me when you want me to tailor any section to your exact models/routes (I’ll update the files end‑to‑end).
